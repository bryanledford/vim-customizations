vim-customizations
==================

My very hacked together vim configuration and plugins. Use at your own risk. 

I'd use this to learn from only. My .vimrc folder is not well organized. 

First, I didn't get Pathogen to work until late in the game. Do yourself a huge favor and get that working first,
that way you can keep your plugins organized.
